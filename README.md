## Developer Instructions

### Configuring and running locally

Pre-Requisites:
- Git
- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL
- Mailgun API Key (if you wish to send out emails while testing)

Pre-Requisites for Debian:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip libpq-dev
```

#### Clone repo and install requirements

```sh
git clone https://github.com/refundcleveland
cd refundcleveland
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Installing PostgreSQL & Creating a Database

If you need to install PostgreSQL, please follow these steps:

1. Install PostgreSQL (https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads). Remember the password!
1. (On Windows) Update your environment path variables. (Step 3 here: https://medium.com/@aeadedoyin/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-windows-201906131300-ee75f066df78)
1. Open a command line and run `psql -U postgres`.  This is the default superuser.  Enter the password you created.
1. Within the postgres terminal, enter the command `CREATE DATABASE <databaseName>;`.
1. Update your local_settings.py file!
1. Run the command `python3 manage.py migrate` within the command line to create tables within your database.

#### Add local settings

Copy and rename **local_settings_template.py** to **local_settings.py**, and fill in environmental variables:

`SECRET_KEY` -- Djangoâ€™s Secret Key used by the project
`GOOGLE_API_KEY` -- Used for Google's Civic Information API to map Address to Political Ward
`MAILGUN_API_KEY` -- Used for the Mailgun API that sends out emails when a user submits a budget

`DATABASES` -- map of parameters to define the connection to a database.  In prod, we are using a postgres db hosted on heroku, and the connection is injected there via config vars.  For local versions, enter the information you used when creating the database.  Example:
```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'refund1',
        'USER': 'postgres',
        'PASSWORD': '<password>',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

#### Run the app

```sh
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8000/

### Running in a production environment
This is currently done through heroku.

### Dependencies
We used the following open source libraries/tools:
d3, django, python3, postgres, Google Civic Information API

### Note on Patches/Pull Requests 

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Send us a pull request. Bonus points for making a new name your branch that describes your changes. For example, if you're improving the css by adding margins for input range element, `css-range-margins` would be appropriate.
