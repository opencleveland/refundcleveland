    <p>The residents of Cleveland have little public input into their city's budget. There is no participatory budgeting program, no budget town hall and few opportunities for the residents of Cleveland to discuss with their elected officials what the
        spending priorities should be in their community. </p>
    <p>This project is designed to make the budget for the City of Cleveland easier to understand. Its agenda is
        to make it clear where the money is going, and to provide people with the opportunity to see the
        difference between their budget priorities and their city government’s priorities.</p> 
	<p>The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.clevelandohio.gov/sites/clevelandohio/files/finance-docs/documents/2025%20City%20of%20Cleveland%20Mayor's%20Estimate_FINAL.pdf">Mayor's 2025 budget estimate</a> is now available. This website examines only the "general fund." Essential parts of life—schools, water, roads, public housing, etc.—each have separate budgets based on different revenue streams that do not compete for funding with the budget items above. Moreover, this project does not examine the legislative or judicial budgets. Determining an appropriate cost for running city council and the court system is complex beyond this project's scope. Instead, the budget captured here is where all the action is. </p>

    <p>Refund Cleveland is a collaborative and community-led effort to design a city budget that centers around
        the values, needs, and priorities of our community. We want to thank <a target="_blank"
